- chronic inflammatory condition of the liver
- characterized by â†‘ serum globulin levels (IgG), presence of circulating autoantibodies, interface hepatitis on histology, plasma cell rich infiltrate

### Types
- type 1 or classic
  - most predominant form
  - bimodal age distribution (10-20 and 45-70 yr of age)
  - positive for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and/or anti smooth muscle antibodies (ASMA)
  - HLA haplotypes: DR3, DR4, DR13
  - excellent response to treatment but long term maintenance therapy needed
- type 2
  - 10% of AIH cases
  - affects young children (2-14y)
  - antibodies to liver/kidney microsomes (anti-LKM-1) or liver cytosol 1
  - HLA haplotypes: DR3 and DR7
  - difficult to treat & long term maintenance therapy needed
 - type 3
  - 10% of AIH cases
  - very similar to AIH-1
  - soluble liver antigen/liver pancreas antigen (SLA/LP) positive
  - Ro52-antibody positive
  - lifelong immunosuppression required in most patients
