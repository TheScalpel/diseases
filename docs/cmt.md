## Pathophysiology
- connexin 32 (Cx32) protein is expressed in Schwann cells (involved in production of myelin around axons in peripheral nervous system)
- mutations in connexin 32 (Cx32) gene → X-linked Charcot Marie Tooth demyelinating neuropathy → progressive degeneration of peripheral nerves → distal muscle weakness and atrophy, impairment of deep tendon reflexes
