## Basics
- X-linked primary immunodeficiency

## Pathogenesis
- Arp2/3 complex is necessary for nucleating the assembly of branched networks of actin filaments
- function of phagocytic cells and platelets depends on a functional actin cytoskeleton
- Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) and SCAR/WAVE1-3 → bind and activate Arp2/3 complex
- mutations in the WAS gene, which encodes WASP → Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome

## Clinical features
- microthrombocytopenia
- eczema
- autoimmunity
- recurrent infections
- predisposition to lymphoma development
